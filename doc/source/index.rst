Resource Template Service (RTS) helps you simplify cloud computing resource management and automate O&M. You can compile a template file and define a collection of cloud computing resources, dependencies between resources, and resource configurations based on the template specifications defined in the RTS service. Then you can automatically create and configure all resources in the template using the orchestration engine to simplify deployment and O&M.
