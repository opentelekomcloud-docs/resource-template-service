Advantages
==========

RTS allows you to model and configure cloud computing resources in a unified way. With RTS, you only need to create a template that describes the required resources and dependencies between those resources. Then, RTS automatically creates and configures all resources in the template using an orchestration engine, simplifying management of cloud resources. RTS has the following advantages:

Providing Template Examples
---------------------------

RTS provides common template examples, and you only need to set values of several parameters such as region and stack name.

Flexibly Combining Multiple Cloud Services
------------------------------------------

RTS supports many core cloud services, such as ECS, EVS, VPC, ELB, SFS, RDS, AS, and Cloud Eye. You can flexibly combine cloud services using templates to meet automatic O&M requirements in different O&M scenarios.

Allowing Batch Operations and Simplifying Resource Management
-------------------------------------------------------------

By defining multiple resource types and resource dependencies in a template, you can deploy all services in a template in batches, which simplifies deployment and saves your time cost. You can also dynamically adjust the stack template based on service requirements. If you do not need a group of resources, you can delete them by one click.
