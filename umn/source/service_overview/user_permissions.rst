User Permissions
================

The cloud system provides two types of user permissions by default, user management and resource management.

-  User management refers to management of users, user groups, and user group permissions.
-  Resource management refers to control of operations on cloud service resources.

For details, see `Permissions <https://docs.otc.t-systems.com/en-us/permissions/index.html>`__.
