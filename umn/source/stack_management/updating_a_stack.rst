Updating a Stack
================

If the existing stack cannot meet your service requirements, you can use the update function to modify the stack. The procedure for updating a stack is the same as that for creating a stack.

#. Log in to the management console.

#. Click |image1| in the upper left corner to select the desired region and project.

#. Under **Management & Deployment**, click **Resource Template Service**.

#. In the stack list, locate the target stack and click **Update** in the **Operation** column.

   The process of updating a stack is displayed.

#. Upload a template.

   You can modify the template content or upload a new template file to update the stack. Note that you can replace the template content with another template or upload a new template package to rebuild the stack.

#. Configure parameters based on the template that you use.

   .. note::

      Updating the stack name is not supported.

#. Confirm that stack configurations are correct and click **Submit**.

   It takes some time to complete the update.

Result
------

Go back to the stack list and check whether stack status changes to **Update complete**. You can also view the updated template and resource information on the stack details page and the entire life cycle of the stack on the **Events** page.
